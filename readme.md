# C++ Nonsense

### Quickstart

I am using the Borland C++ Compiler in a Windows 10 environment.  Kinda supprised this works.

To compile
`bcc32x.exe sizes.cpp`

then to run
`sizes.exe`

With custom build location
`bcc32x.exe sizes.cpp -o bin\sizes.exe`

I do not have the compiler directory in my path so this is what I use:

`C:\Users\ATeg\Downloads\BCC102\bin\bcc32x.exe sizes.cpp -o bin\sizes.exe & bin\sizes.exe`

### Background

I have not done serious C++ progamming since High School, and I do not plan to get back into it now, but during my last round of interviews, that was the programming language that everyone wanted to talk about.  I spoke of the High School experience, which was not positive, and the books that I had read and did not understand, which got me thinking about revisiting the books.  I still have all of them, and maybe, now, with the experience and wisdom of years that I have gained, I should look to the texts once more.

This is not an attempt to learn about a language, but to learn about myself, and where it went sour that first time.  I have no plans to make anything good, or even all that original, but I do wonder where this will take me.  To the adventure.
